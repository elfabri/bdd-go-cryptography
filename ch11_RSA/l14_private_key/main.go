/*
While (n, e) is the public key, d is the private key.
That said, d can be derived from p and q,
so you can also consider the pair of p and q the
private key, but it's just different ways to look at it.

At the end of the day, p, q, tot and d should
all be kept secret, there's no reason
to share anything other than (n, e).

Generating D
d is simply the modular multiplicative inverse of e (mod tot).

Complete the getD function.

getD(e, tot *big.Int) *big.Int
Use the ModInverse method to calculate d and return it.
